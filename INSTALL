Note: purpled is not even alpha. Alot of stuff is undecided yet. This file
provides not a release-grade information, but some hints on how to get
this dirty source working. 

//Depends on: glib >= 2.0, libpurple.


###
### BUILD
###

##
## FreeBSD
#

Install libpurple from ports (I found it in /usr/ports/net-im/libpurple)

$ cp Makefile.BSD Makefile
$ make


##
## Using automake
#

Copy aclocal.m4 and acinclude.m4 from pidgin source distribution.

Now you can just:

$ autoconf
$ ./configure
$ make

##
## Edit makefile
#

Do we really need autoconf to find 2 libraries?

Perhaps one can get away by just editing the Makefile. 
All it needs are header paths for glib and libpurple.

$ vi Makefile
$ make

##
## Why so incosistent?
#

As many things with purpled, that was left undecided and can go
both ways from here. Uh oh. 


###
### INSTALL
###

So where should you put purpled? Another good question I don't have
answer for. Well, 1 idea would be to use
/usr/local/bin 		-- for binary
/usr/local/etc/purpled  -- for config
/var/log/purpled.log	-- log file

But, some people prefer to run things this way (especialy where 
there are indeed other users on the machine):

/home/user/purpled	-- binary, config, logs


Should purpled be running under root?
    As far as I can tell: NO! NO! NO!


###
### RUN
###

Synopsis:
  purpled [-d] [-pPORT] [-lLISTEN_IP]

Options:
  -d             run purpled a unix daemon
  -pPORT         specify on which TCP port purpled listen. Default: 32000
  -lLISTEN_IP    specify on which IP address purpled listen. Default: any 0.0.0.0

Examples:
  purpled, listen on port 4242 and stay in the terminal.
      $ purple -p4242

  purpled, listen on IP address 127.0.0.1 and start as a deamon.
      $ purple -l127.0.0.1 -d
