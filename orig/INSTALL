Note: purpled is alpha. Alot of stuff is undecided yet. This file
provides not a release-grade information, but some hints on how to get
this dirty source working. 

//Depends on: glib >= 2.0, libpurple.


###
### BUILD
###

##
## FreeBSD
#

Install libpurple from ports (I found it in /usr/ports/net-im/libpurple)

$ gmake check_deps
$ gmake


##
## linux
#

Install libpurple and glib-2.0 development headers

$ make check_deps
$ make


###
### INSTALL
###

So where should you put purpled? Another good question I don't have
answer for. Well, 1 idea would be to use
/usr/local/bin		-- for binary
/etc/init.d 		-- for init script

But, some people prefer to run things this way (especialy where 
there are indeed other users on the machine):

/home/user/purpled	-- binary, config, logs


Should purpled be running under root?
    As far as I can tell: NO! NO! NO!


###
### RUN
###

Synopsis:
  purpled [-d] [-pPORT] [-lLISTEN_IP]

Options:
  -d             run purpled a unix daemon
  -pPORT         specify on which TCP port purpled listen. Default: 32000
  -lLISTEN_IP    specify on which IP address purpled listen. Default: any 0.0.0.0

Examples:
  purpled, listen on port 4242 and stay in the terminal.
      $ purple -p4242

  purpled, listen on IP address 127.0.0.1 and start as a deamon.
      $ purple -l127.0.0.1 -d


###
### INIT SCRIPTS
###

Synopsis:
    purpled.init start|stop|restart|status

examples:
$ purpled.init start
$ purpled.init stop

you may need to change the 5 variables at the begining.

purpled=./purpled			# where the purpled binary is located
pidfile=./purpled.pid		# where the pid is stored
logfile=./purpled.log		# where logs are stored

listen_port=5999			# param given to the -p option
listen_ip=127.0.0.1			# param given to the -l option
